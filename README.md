## Be thinking of for when the interview comes

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along with the lines of the items below. Have at least one answer for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing product
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

## Have questions for the interviewer

Some of mine (I already may know the answers, but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?
- How is the work/life balance?

    - The canonical design patterns book
- [Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202) (Skiena)
    - As a review and problem recognition
    - The algorithm catalog portion is well beyond the scope of difficulty you'll get in an interview
    - This book has 2 parts:
        - Class textbook on data structures and algorithms
            - Pros:
                - Is a good review as any algorithms textbook would be
                - Nice stories from his experiences solving problems in industry and academia
                - Code examples in C
            - Cons:
                - Can be as dense or impenetrable as CLRS, and in some cases, CLRS may be a better alternative for some subjects
                - Chapters 7, 8, 9 can be painful to try to follow, as some items are not explained well or require more brain than I have
                - Don't get me wrong: I like Skiena, his teaching style, and mannerisms, but I may not be Stony Brook material
        - Algorithm catalog:
            - This is the real reason you buy this book.
            - This book is better as an algorithm reference, and not something you read cover to cover.
    - Can rent it on Kindle

- [Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Write-Great-Code-Understanding-Machine/dp/1593270038)
    - The book was published in 2004, and is somewhat outdated, but it's a terrific resource for understanding a computer in brief
    - The author invented [HLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Level_Assembly), so take mentions and examples in HLA with a grain of salt. Not widely used, but decent examples of what assembly looks like
    - These chapters are worth the read to give you a nice foundation:
        - Chapter 2 - Numeric Representation
        - Chapter 3 - Binary Arithmetic and Bit Operations
        - Chapter 4 - Floating-Point Representation
        - Chapter 5 - Character Representation

- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X)
    - **Important:** Reading this book will only have limited value. This book is a great review of algorithms and data structures, but won't teach you how to write good code. You have to be able to code a decent solution efficiently
    - AKA CLR, sometimes CLRS, because Stein was late to the game
- [Computer Architecture, Sixth Edition: A Quantitative Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0128119055)
    - For a richer, more up-to-date (2017), but longer treatment

## System Design, Scalability, Data Handling

**You can expect system design questions if you have 4+ years of experience.**

- Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since
      there is a lot to consider when designing a software/hardware system that can scale.
      Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this
- Considerations:
    - Scalability
        - Distill large data sets to single values
        - Transform one data set to another
        - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
    - System design
        - features sets
        - interfaces
        - class hierarchies
        - designing a system under certain constraints
        - simplicity and robustness
        - tradeoffs
        - performance analysis and optimization

    - flow:
        1. Understand the problem and scope:
            - Define the use cases, with interviewer's help
            - Suggest additional features
            - Remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
            - Assume high availability is required, add as a use case
        2. Think about constraints:
            - Ask how many requests per month
            - Ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
            - Estimate reads vs. writes percentage
            - Keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
            - How much data written per second
            - Total storage required over 5 years
            - How much data read per second
        3. Abstract design:
            - Layers (service, data, caching)
            - Infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
            - Rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
            - Consider bottlenecks and determine solutions

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know at least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code
        - Splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - Search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets
    - [Self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)

    - **AVL trees**
        - In practice:
            From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
            The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
            balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
            attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
            dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)

    - **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking and file system code) etc

            - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnPl_Y6EqMo)

    - **Red/black trees**
        - These are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used

    - **2-3 search trees**
        - In practice:
            2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).
        - You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

    - **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

        - note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)
        - binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2
        - 2-3 trees are 3-ary

    - **B-Trees**
        - Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address

## Additional Detail on Some Subjects

    I added these to reinforce some ideas already presented above, but didn't want to include them
    above because it's just too much. It's easy to overdo it on a subject.
